# Module-6-challenge

I pulled the defined function from chat GPT using the prompt Define a linear regression using linregress: https://chat.openai.com/c/c338ba7c-7996-449e-a2c9-f5b4b313492c
Rest of the code is my own. I was unable to work on vacation notebook due to not able to run the nessecary python imports.
